    *   Applying problem-solving strategies to geometry-related problems.

*   **Detailed Task Description:** Students will individually design a coordinate plane-based game that incorporates translations, reflections, and rotations.

    1.  **Game Concept:** Brainstorm ideas for your game. Think about a theme (e.g., space exploration, treasure hunting, maze navigation). What are the rules of your game? How do players win?
    2.  **Coordinate Plane:** Create a coordinate plane that covers all four quadrants (positive and negative x and y values). You can use graph paper or create a digital plane.
    3.  **Game Elements:** Design the elements of your game (e.g., player pieces, obstacles, targets). Represent these elements as shapes on the coordinate plane.
    4.  **Transformations:** Your game *must* include at least one instance of each of the following transformations:
        *   **Translation:** Moving a shape by a given vector (e.g., move the player piece 3 units to the right and 2 units up).
        *   **Reflection:** Reflecting a shape across the x-axis or y-axis.
        *   **Rotation:** Rotating a shape 90°, 180°, or 270° about a given point (e.g., the origin).
    5.  **Rules and Objectives:** Write clear and concise rules for your game. What are the objectives? How do players move? How do they use transformations? How do they win? Your game must be playable by at least two players.
    6.  **Solution Key:** Create a solution key that demonstrates the correct execution of each transformation in your game. Show the coordinates of the shape before and after each transformation.
    7.  **Playtest:** If possible, play your game with classmates and get feedback on the rules, gameplay, and level of challenge.
