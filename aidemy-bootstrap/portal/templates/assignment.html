            <h3>Context:</h3>
            <p>Geometry is all around us! From the shapes of buildings to the designs of everyday objects, understanding shapes helps us make sense of the world. In this assignment, you will become shape detectives and 3D city planners, exploring the properties of 2D and 3D shapes and applying your knowledge in a creative way.</p>

            <h3>Learning Objectives Assessed:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reviewing basic 2D shapes (squares, rectangles, triangles, circles) and their properties (sides, angles, lines of symmetry).</li>
                <li>Classifying triangles (equilateral, isosceles, scalene, and right-angled).</li>
                <li>Classifying quadrilaterals (square, rectangle, parallelogram, rhombus, trapezium, kite).</li>
                <li>Introducing 3D shapes (cubes, cuboids, pyramids, prisms) and their properties (faces, edges, vertices).</li>
                <li>Constructing nets for 3D shapes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Detailed Task Description:</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Choose one of the following 2D shapes: square, rectangle, triangle, or circle.</li>
                <li>Create a "Wanted" poster for your chosen shape. Your poster must include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A drawing of the shape.</li>
                        <li>A description of its properties (number of sides, angles, lines of symmetry, parallel sides, etc.).</li>
                        <li>At least three real-world examples of where the shape can be found (e.g., a square tile, a rectangular door).</li>
                        <li>An explanation of why this shape is important or useful.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h4>Part 2: 3D Shape Architects (Collaborative - Groups of 3-4)</h4>
            <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To design and build a miniature city using 3D shapes constructed from nets.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>As a group, brainstorm ideas for your miniature city. Think about different types of buildings and structures you could create using 3D shapes.</li>
                <li>Construct nets for at least five different 3D shapes (cubes, cuboids, pyramids, prisms are good starting points). You can find templates online or design your own.</li>
                <li>Build your 3D shapes from the nets. Be precise with your measurements and folds to ensure the shapes are accurate.</li>
                <li>Arrange your 3D shapes to create your miniature city.</li>

            <h3>Context:</h3>
            <p>Understanding area, perimeter, volume, and surface area is crucial for designing and optimizing spaces. Whether you're planning a garden, arranging furniture in a room, or building a house, these measurements help us make informed decisions. In this assignment, you'll become Measurement Masters and redesign a classroom space or part of the school playground, applying your mathematical knowledge to improve the design.</p>

            <h3>Learning Objectives Assessed:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Applying formulas for area and perimeter of rectangles, squares, triangles, and parallelograms.</li>
                <li>Calculating area and perimeter of compound shapes.</li>

                <li>Calculating the surface area of cubes and cuboids.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Detailed Task Description:</h3>
            <p>Students will work in pairs to redesign a classroom space (e.g., the reading corner, the art station) or a part of the school playground.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Choose a Space:</strong> Select a specific area to redesign (classroom corner, part of playground, etc.) and get it approved by the teacher.</li>
                <li><strong>Measure:</strong> Accurately measure the existing space and any objects within it (length, width, height). Use appropriate units (meters, centimeters). Record all measurements carefully.</li>
                <li><strong>Plan:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create a scaled drawing of the existing space, showing all existing objects and their dimensions. Choose an appropriate scale (e.g., 1 cm = 1 meter).</li>
                        <li>Develop a plan for your redesigned space. Consider how you can improve the space's functionality, aesthetics, or usability.</li>
                        <li>Create a scaled drawing of your proposed redesign, including all new objects, their dimensions, and their placement.</li>

                        <li>Area of the floor and any other relevant surfaces (walls, table tops, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Perimeter of the space and any key objects.</li>
                        <li>Volume of any 3D objects (boxes, planters, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Surface area of relevant objects.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <p>Coordinate planes aren't just abstract mathematical concepts – they're the foundation for many games, animations, and computer graphics! Understanding transformations on the coordinate plane allows us to create and manipulate objects in a digital world. In this assignment, you'll become Geometry Game Designers, creating your own coordinate plane-based game that incorporates translations, reflections, and rotations.</p>

            <h3>Learning Objectives Assessed:</h3>

                <li><strong>Coordinate Plane:</strong> Create a coordinate plane that covers all four quadrants (positive and negative x and y values). You can use graph paper or create a digital plane.</li>
                <li><strong>Game Elements:</strong> Design the elements of your game (e.g., player pieces, obstacles, targets). Represent these elements as shapes on the coordinate plane.</li>
                <li><strong>Transformations:</strong> Your game <em>must</em> include at least one instance of each of the following transformations:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Translation:</strong> Moving a shape by a given vector (e.g., move the player piece 3 units to the right and 2 units up).</li>
                        <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Reflecting a shape across the x-axis or y-axis.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rotation:</strong> Rotating a shape 90°, 180°, or 270° about a given point (e.g., the origin).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Rules and Objectives:</strong> Write clear and concise rules for your game. What are the objectives? How do players move? How do they use transformations? How do they win? Your game must be playable by at least two players.</li>
                <li><strong>Solution Key:</strong> Create a solution key that demonstrates the correct execution of each transformation in your game. Show the coordinates of the shape before and after each transformation.</li>
                <li><strong>Playtest:</strong> If possible, play your game with classmates and get feedback on the rules, gameplay, and level of challenge.</li>
                <li><strong>Reflection:</strong> Write a short reflection (1 page) on the design process. What were the challenges you faced? How did you overcome them? What feedback did you receive from other students? What would you change if you could design the game again?</li>
            </ol>

                <li>Solution key demonstrating the correct execution of translations, reflections, and rotations, including before and after coordinates.</li>
                <li>A short reflection (1 page) on the design process, challenges, feedback, and improvements.</li>

            <h3>Estimated Time Commitment:</h3>
            <p>5-7 hours (including game design, game board creation, rule writing, solution key development, and reflection)</p>

            <h3>Differentiation:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Support:</strong> Provide pre-made coordinate plane templates. Offer step-by-step instructions for performing transformations. Allow students to focus on one or two types of transformations instead of all three.</li>
